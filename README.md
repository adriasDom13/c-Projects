The respondent of the proposed project capstone study consists of three category which are the Staff, Managers and Task Administrators most of them are Digital marketing and certified professionals that has experienced enough to understand the researcher proposed study. From the population size of 60 staffs and 8 Managers as of November 2022, a sample size with sufficient number of participants to adequately address the research question that can be used to estimate the sample size needed to produce a confidence interval estimate with a specified margin of error (precision) or to ensure that a test has a high probability of detecting a meaningful difference in the parameter, yielding response rates of 40% from the staffs and 60% among in the managers. 
The researcher will employ a standardized questionnaire for ISO using the Software 
Product Quality standards commonly known as ISO/IEC 25010. ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. This system quality model defined in ISO/IEC 25010 comprises the eight quality characteristics this are Functional 
Suitability, Performance Efficiency, Compatibility, Usability, Reliability, Security, Maintainability and Portability to provide a current situation in identifying its critical success factors, barriers, and benefits of implementation.   
This is where the researcher will compile their findings and synthesize them in order to determine the core problems and issue that respondents have identified up to this point. The researcher chooses to use quantitative research, because variables are defined and identified, and then relevant data is collected from study participants. The strength of this type of research is that the data is in numeric form, making it easier to examine. In additional, Data can be incredibly constant, precise, and reliable. With the help of Likert scale, we can identify the grades given by the respondents on the current state of the system and the proposed system. 


Data Gathering Procedure  
  The proposed capstone project research will be conducted out and distributed through a survey system, with the respondents filling out MS forms and sent it via email to the respondents. Additionally, the researcher performed a one-hour online interview with four individuals: The Task Administrator of the DM team, two managers, and one staff. This entails consulting specialists to learn more about the area of concern by observing, interacting, and empathizing with these people to learn about their experiences with the existing available solution and to obtain a more intimate grasp of the issues involved. The researcher recognizes that there is still room for improvement in the procedure, and that limited features will have an impact on the research study's implementation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Statistical Data Analysis and Procedure  
  The information gathered will be analyzed both descriptively and inferentially. In addition, the number of responders in each part will be determined using frequency distribution and percentage. Descriptive statistics are crucial because it would be difficult to visualize what the data was indicating if we just presented it as raw data, especially if there was a lot of it. As a result, descriptive statistics helps us to present data in a more meaningful fashion, making data interpretation easier. The researcher will utilize this statistics method to evaluate if the data is normal during the examination. In this research study, descriptive statistics will be utilized to characterize the essential aspects of the data. It has the ability to produce basic summaries of the sample and measures Together with simple graphics 
analysis, they form the basis of virtually every quantitative analysis of data.  
In addition, the researcher will utilize the t-test as a statistical tool to see if there is a 
significant difference between the current system and the planned capstone study implementation. The T-Test is used to see if a technique has an effect on both samples and if the groups are different from one another. It allows the mean of two systems to be compared. We can determine and identify whether the implemented system is approved or rejected by the respondents and beneficiaries based on the comparison. We can identify if there is a significant difference between the current system and the proposed system by using comparative analysis comparing the results of the questionnaire prepared by the proponents to be answered by different respondents such as IT experts,  Task Administrators, managers, and students.  

With the given statistical method based on the grade given by the respondent we were able to answer the statement of the problem #3 if there is a significance between the current system and the proposed system. 
The respondent is to establish an acceptance level of Type I error at standard deviation ( ) = 0.05, wherein any P-value greater than 0.05 means the process is normal. While P-value is less than 0.05 means otherwise.  A p-value is a measure of the probability that an observed difference could have occurred just by random chance. The standard deviation is a statistic that measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean and is calculated as the square




The above system workflow model it explains and summarized the flow and the concept of the propose project study. It shows how users can interact with the system starting from the log in of user credential which required the user to input his/her email address and password. it also demonstrates how users can reset password by entering their email and how system match it on the record from the data and sending them an email containing their password. It also illustrates on the work flow the different type of user’s access levels which are the Task Administrator, Staff and the Manager, together with their different access privileged on the system, which is users can create new activities, acknowledge new task, create and manage activities, generate reports, amen task details 		and an access individual and team utilization. 
 

The above entity relationship diagram (ERD) is a graphical representation that depicts the relationship between the User Types, Activity types, Users, Utilization, Attendance, and Leaves in the proposed capstone projects it also shows the value of the table in the database. 


The interactions between the system and its actors are depicted and identified in the above use case diagram. In use-case diagrams, the use cases and actors define what the system does and how the actors interact with it, but not how the system works inside. The above diagram also depicts the three categories of actors:  Task Administrator, managers, and staff, as well as the proposed capstone project's eight key functions. 


The proposed study will go through a proof-of-concept (POC) design implementation of data distribution, there will be not much complicated task in the designing code and data of this propose capstone study. Also, all data of this system will be going to deploy in a every user’s machine and a cloud-based platform for data storing. One of the project's deliverables in this stage is a desktop software prototype. It will be presented to the recipient in order to suit their requirements. 

Development - For the recommended design implementation, C# programming language can be used and DAX function of Power BI for reporting. The proposed capstone research is a desktop application can be accessed through the use of an installed application. The development team and operations must be taught in its use, and the researcher utilized MSSQL to store all data in the database. At this time, the ERD will be moved to a real database. As part of this phase's deliverables, the deployed staging system will be used to demonstrate to the beneficiary. 


The suggested capstone project will be built utilizing the Dot net framework and C# programming language, a popular open-source Windows application framework that is mostly used for desktop application development. The proposed capstone research is a. MSSQL Azure Database was chosen as the system's data base, which will be kept on the cloud. 


The data flow diagram illustration above shows the flow of all data from three access levels within the system: The Task Administrator, Staff, and Managers. It also shows all the process on the system and how data will be stored and generated. 
 The administration, it demonstrates how the Task Administrator will log and provide activity details. In addition, and security feature the Task Administrator also has an additional access to see and view the unassigned activities on the system to ensure no task are left behind from the system. The staff can acknowledge request and start working on it until it is completed. It also shows how managers can get individual and team utilization to optimize staff capacity to do tasks. 
 
 
Data Analysis and Visualization 
After the visitation and discussion with the Digital marketing team, which is the beneficiary of the capstone project, we discussed that for the data analysis with the data visualization feature of the system, we are going to analyze all the data that has been processed and input to the system and transform all data into graphical representation using interactive visualization tools as a feature of the entire system. 
The below data is the one that will be analyzed and transformed into a graphical representation. 
1.)	How many activities were acknowledged and not acknowledged? 
2.)	Identify those staff with low and high utilization rate.
3.)	How much time an individual or team spent in a daily and weekly basis for billable work? 
4.)	Which individual or team has the capability to get more task? 
5.)	Identify the top 10 requestors with higher utilization demand.
6.)	What kind of activity gets the highest utilization?
7.)	Count in progress task, completed by staff and team level.
8.)	Show demand trend in a monthly and quarterly basis.
